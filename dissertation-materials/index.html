<p>(<strong>Chapter 1 &amp; Chapter 2</strong>) The stunning variety of forms exhibited by angiosperms has fascinated biologists for centuries. Both the reproductive organs and the mechanisms by which reproduction ensues are more diverse in this group of organisms than any other. Because sexual systems determine the patterns and distribution of genetic variation, they have important macroevolutionary and ecological consequences. Despite this, there remains a surprising paucity of data regarding their distribution in some of the largest plant families, limiting the potential to answer questions about how and why these systems evolve and inform expectations for future study.</p>

<h2 id="---1">üåç üìö üí≠</h2>

<p>(<strong>Chapter 3</strong>) Evolutionary biology is widely regarded as the framework that organizes the entire discipline of biological sciences. To wit, there is no <em>why</em> in biology without underlying evolutionary processes. Despite this, evolution is often taught separately from other biological disciplines and sometimes not at all. Not only does this impede the construction of a conceptual framework in biological sciences generally, but the concepts required to fully understand evolutionary theory are also necessary for basic science literacy.</p>
<p>Natural selection is well-known as a concept in evolutionary theory that is particularly challenging for students. More than a dozen papers in the last thirty years (see 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/70beh9ywzn9zuvw/2018-ziadie-evolution.pdf?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ziadie and Andrews, 2018</a> for review) have examined student thinking as it relates to natural selection. And yet, confusion regarding natural selection is tenacious, including among college graduates and teachers. Unlike previous studies that focus on natural selection as a whole, by focusing on the process of natural selection through the nuanced lens of FF&amp;F, we can more carefully probe the underlying logic of students&rsquo; beliefs. Until educators have a clearer picture of such logic, biology education will remain a difficult challenge. Here we propose an open-ended pre-post assessment to examine student thinking as it relates to FF&amp;F in two populations of undergraduate students.</p>

<p>(<strong>Potential Chapter 4</strong>)
A growing body of research aims to understand and treat cancer by viewing carcinogenesis as a speciation event inside the host, giving rise to a new parasitic organism. This organism is subject to the same evolutionary and ecological dynamics as all others &ndash; that is, cancer evolves in response to its environment through a combination of stochastic and deterministic forces. Yet a frequent question is often raised in response to this idea: if cancer is adaptive, why then does it kill its host?</p>
<p>There are a variety of theoretical models that suggest several ways in which natural selection or individual adaptations can be detrimental to a population overall. Empirical evidence from the bacterium <em>Myxococcus xanthus</em> has demonstrated that artifically selected &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; strains invade wild-type strains, ultimately causing the extinction of the entire population 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691394/pdf/12965020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Fiegna and Velicer 2003)</a>. Yet natural selection is commonly misunderstood as an optimization process that works for the &ldquo;overall good of the species&rdquo;. This misconception is tenacious, perhaps in response to the overwhelming variety of organisms that appear perfectly designed to suit their environment. But this is not the case &ndash; natural selection may be non-random, but is not goal-driven or forward-thinking.</p>

<h4 id="_dissertation-proposal_"><em>Dissertation Proposal</em></h4>
<p>For thousands of years, humans have sought explanations for the origins of our natural world and the vast complexity of life it contains. Before the familiar One God, Seven Days, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other stories confronting the difficult question of how organisms on Earth came to be. Many, many eggs ‚Äî the infant god P‚Äôan Ku, floating perpetually in the inchoate sea of Chaos, the Egyptian sun god Ra, the Finnish diving duck, whose egg fragments on the knee of the goddess of air gave birth to the world. Creation <em>de novo</em>, <em>ex nihilo</em>, creation from chaos ‚Äî what precipitated such, as Darwin so famously put it, ‚Äúendless forms most beautiful and most wonderful‚Äù (Darwin 1859, pg. 490)? What gave rise to these endless forms, and moreover, why are they so thoroughly suited to their environment?</p>
<p>Many of these perennial questions find answers within the processes of evolution. We now know that natural selection is the &ldquo;blind watchmaker&rdquo; 
<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Blind_Watchmaker.html?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Dawkins, 1996)</a> that makes organisms seem as if they are designed expressly for their environment. It is the process that gives rise to adaptations: organisms appear engineered for specific tasks, interfacing with their surrounding ecology using remarkably honed sets of tools

We refer to this concept as &ldquo;fit of form and function&rdquo; (FF&amp;F): this idea &mdash; specifically, the observation that organisms are uniquely well-suited to their environments &mdash; was established long before the theory of evolution itself and is a common thread woven throughout religious, philosophical and scientific thinking for millenia. It is here that we aim to probe student understanding.</p>

<h4 id="_manuscript-in-prep_"><em>Manuscript in Prep</em></h4>
<p>Nearly half of all land plant species are self-incompatible. While the molecular mechanisms that underpin self-incompatibility differ across angiosperms, the mechanisms themselves share some important features, including a fundamental role in shaping the genetic structure of populations and frequent transitions to self-compatibility. Independent gains and the persistence of many such mechanisms across vast timescales suggests a strong role of natural selection. And yet, surprisingly little is known regarding the distribution of incompatibility systems &mdash; especially their genetic and molecular bases, and their evolutionary relationships &mdash; in some of the largest angiosperm families, including the legumes (Fabaceae).</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i7uha298dl2uw8c/arroyo1981.pdf?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arroyo (1981)</a> analyzed a breeding system collection of more than 300 species in this family.
Here, we re-visit the same sources of data, as well as add new data, yielding a database with 1285 species &mdash; 6.6% of those recognized in the family &mdash; across 190 genera spanning five of the six currently recognized subfamilies. We use this data to re-examine two long-standing hypotheses: (1) that Fabaceae shares the same potentially ancestral self-incompatibility system as the closely-related Rosaceae, and (2) that polyploidy and self-compatibility are associated. We also evaluate the relationship between breeding systems and potentially correlated traits, to determine if previously established patterns in Fabaceae hold with the addition of new data, and if patterns established in other angiosperm families are also observed here.</p>

<h4 id="_manuscript-prep-pending_">(<em>Manuscript Prep Pending</em>)</h4>
<p>One of the largest families of organisms on Earth, the orchids are known for their stunning diversity of plant-pollinator relationships. While most species are thought to be self-compatible, self-incompatibility has been uncovered in several genera ‚Äî most notably <em>Dendrobium</em>. No common SI mechanism has been observed across monocot families as in eudicots, but incompatibility has been observed in several monocot groups including the closely-related Iridaceae. There is an important need for breeding system data across all angiosperm families. As such systems are factors known to influence diversification and extinction, it is especially vital to determine their distribution in these species-rich groups.</p>
