So what does this mean for the student of biology?\nHundreds of studies indicate that students maintain tenacious misconceptions regarding the evolutionary principles necessary for recognizing levels of biological explanation. To dissect these misconceptions, I administered a pre-post assignment with open-ended reflective questions to explore (1) how students construct explanations about natural selection and adaptation across several levels of postsecondary study, and (2) the extent to which their explanations change as they continue formal biology instruction. My framework, adapted from Tinbergen’s Four Questions, categorizes students’ answers based on the level of explanation addressed.

These strategies ultimately determine the distribution of genetic variation within populations and dictate the resultant patterns of evolution, as differences in breeding systems yield differing levels of outcrossing and recombination. Although nearly half of all flowering plant species are self-incompatible (SI), the mechanisms that underpin this trait differ dramatically between families. Indeed, independent gains and the persistence of many such mechanisms across vast timescales suggests a strong role of natural selection. And yet, surprisingly little is known regarding the distribution of incompatibility systems \u0026mdash; their genetic and molecular bases, and their evolutionary relationships \u0026mdash; in most angiosperm families.\nThis lack of data is notable in agriculturally important Fabaceae, which contains roughly seven percent of all flowering plants. A specific type of SI \u0026mdash; S-RNase-based GSI \u0026mdash; is found in many distantly-related eudicot families, including the fairly well-studied Rosaceae. Dozens of studies hypothesize that closely-related Fabaceae shares the same system, but this remains an open question. Uncovering the answer is essential for understanding factors that influence breeding system evolution and ultimately macroevolutionary patterns in angiosperms.\n","date":1585247881,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585247881,"objectID":"57574fb1eb15b15d951ab44361549930","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/project/bslegumes/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T13:38:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/bslegumes/","section":"project","summary":"The stunning variety of forms exhibited by angiosperms has fascinated biologists for centuries.
