While most species are thought to be self-compatible (SC), self-incompatibility (SI) has been uncovered in several genera --- most notably _Dendrobium_. No common SI mechanism has been observed in the monocot group as in eudicots, but several have been uncovered in families closely related to Orchidaceae. There is an important need for breeding system data across all angiosperm families, especially monocots, in order to determine the processes responsible for breeding system evolution. As breeding systems are factors known to influence diversification and extinction, it is especially vital to determine the patterns of such traits in this extraordinarily species-rich group of flowering plants.","tags":[],"title":"Breeding Systems in the Orchids","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"test summary: \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1585246501,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585246501,"objectID":"57574fb1eb15b15d951ab44361549930","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/project/bslegumes/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T13:15:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/bslegumes/","section":"project","summary":"The stunning variety of forms displayed by angiosperms has fascinated biologists for centuries. Both the reproductive organs and the mechanisms by which reproduction ensues are more diverse in this group of organisms than any other. Because sexual systems determine the patterns and distribution of genetic variation, they have important macroevolutionary and ecological consequences. Despite this, there remains a surprising paucity of data regarding their distribution in some of the largest plant families, limiting the potential to answer questions about how and why these systems evolve and inform expectations for future study.","tags":["Fabaceae"],"title":"Breeding Systems in the Legumes","type":"project"}]
