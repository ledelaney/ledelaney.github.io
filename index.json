To wit, there is no why in biology without underlying evolutionary processes. Despite this, evolution is often taught separately from other biological disciplines and sometimes not at all. Not only does this impede the construction of a conceptual framework in biological sciences generally, but the concepts required to fully understand evolutionary theory are also necessary for basic science literacy.\nWhile genes are ultimately critical for understanding inheritance, they are clearly less critical understanding the process of natural selection. In fact, a strictly genetic approach to teaching natural selection will likely be insufficient for student understanding as this approach is almost completely devoid of ecology. Without the appropriate ecological context, the patterns produced by the process natural selection are difficult to interpret \u0026mdash; why are organisms (and their associated adaptations) distributed as they are, and not some other way? Why are there so many organisms on Earth, and why are they all so different?\nUnderstanding natural selection is essential to understanding biological diversity, species distribution, and trait distribution, but it is also essential for other disciplines vital to human survival like medicine and agriculture. Moreover, it can aid in building the kind of conceptual framework lacking for most undergraduate students in biology: instead of simply memorizing the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, understanding their evolutionary relationship creates a foundation on which these facts can be constructed meaningfully.\n","date":1585249242,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585249242,"objectID":"9d816d84da2e1abc586a3730fd3ebcef","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/project/logicadaptation/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T14:00:42-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/logicadaptation/","section":"project","summary":"Educators have long been aware that students enter the classroom with a variety of ideas and beliefs about the natural world that are often at odds with established science. Such ideas and beliefs have been the subject of a large body of research --- also called misconceptions, alternative conceptions, prescientific ideas, intuitive beliefs, and more --- that has repeatedly shown that they interfere with studentsâ€™ ability to appropriately understand and relate concepts. While thousands of studies have attempted to catalogue these misconceptions across many disciplines (see Duit, 2006 for a running bibliography of more than eight thousand papers), a growing body of work is attempting to understand the _how_ and the _why_ of misconceptions: what is it about the way we think and reason that causes such misconceptions to form, and why are they so resistant to formal training?","tags":["BER","Evolution Outreach"],"title":"The Logic of Adaptation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Angiosperms maintain a diverse array of strategies to ensure successful pollination. These strategies ultimately determine the distribution of genetic variation within populations and dictate the resultant patterns of evolution, as differences in breeding systems yield differing levels of outcrossing and recombination. Although nearly half of all flowering plant species are self-incompatible (SI), the mechanisms that underpin this trait differ dramatically between families. Indeed, independent gains and the persistence of many such mechanisms across vast timescales suggests a strong role of natural selection. And yet, surprisingly little is known regarding the distribution of incompatibility systems \u0026mdash; their genetic and molecular bases, and their evolutionary relationships \u0026mdash; in most angiosperm families.\nThis lack of data is notable in agriculturally important Fabaceae, which contains roughly seven percent of all flowering plants. A specific type of SI \u0026mdash; S-RNase-based GSI \u0026mdash; is found in many distantly-related eudicot families, including the fairly well-studied Rosaceae. Dozens of studies hypothesize that closely-related Fabaceae shares the same system, but this remains an open question. Uncovering the answer is essential for understanding factors that influence breeding system evolution and ultimately macroevolutionary patterns in angiosperms.\n","date":1585247881,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585247881,"objectID":"57574fb1eb15b15d951ab44361549930","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/project/bslegumes/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T13:38:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/bslegumes/","section":"project","summary":"The stunning variety of forms displayed by angiosperms has fascinated biologists for centuries. Both the reproductive organs and the mechanisms by which reproduction ensues are more diverse in this group of organisms than any other. Because sexual systems determine the patterns and distribution of genetic variation, they have important macroevolutionary and ecological consequences. Despite this, there remains a surprising paucity of data regarding their distribution in some of the largest plant families, limiting the potential to answer questions about how and why these systems evolve and inform expectations for future study.","tags":["Breeding System Evolution","Fabaceae"],"title":"Breeding Systems in the Legumes","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Stay tuned: more to come!\n","date":1585246535,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585246535,"objectID":"9bfb9fae9ef38a632398f223ae44b210","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/project/bsorchids/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T13:15:35-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/bsorchids/","section":"project","summary":"One of the largest families of organisms on Earth, the orchids are known for their stunning diversity of plant-pollinator relationships. While most species are thought to be self-compatible, self-incompatibility has been uncovered in several genera --- most notably _Dendrobium_. No common incompatibility mechanism has been observed in the monocot group as in eudicots, but several have been uncovered in families closely related to Orchidaceae. There is an important need for breeding system data across all angiosperm families, especially monocots, in order to determine the processes responsible for breeding system evolution. As breeding systems are factors known to influence diversification and extinction, it is especially vital to determine the patterns of such traits in this extraordinarily species-rich group of flowering plants.","tags":["Breeding System Evolution","Orchidaceae"],"title":"Breeding Systems in the Orchids","type":"project"},{"authors":["Delaney, L.E.","Ramanauskas, K.","IgiÄ‡, B."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1532710385,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532710385,"objectID":"e86d4701789c91434fd38bc1e1ba1c58","permalink":"https://ledelaney.github.io/publication/fabaceae-poster/","publishdate":"2018-07-27T11:53:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fabaceae-poster/","section":"publication","summary":"Poster presented at the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of America, Rochester, MN.","tags":["Breeding System Evolution"],"title":"Breeding System Distribution in the Legumes","type":"publication"}]
