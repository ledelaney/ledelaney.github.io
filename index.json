Both the reproductive organs and the mechanisms by which reproduction ensues are more diverse in this group of organisms than any other. Because sexual systems determine the patterns and distribution of genetic variation, they have important macroevolutionary and ecological consequences. Despite this, there remains a surprising paucity of data regarding their distribution in some of the largest plant families, limiting the potential to answer questions about how and why these systems evolve and inform expectations for future study.","tags":["Fabaceae"],"title":"Breeding Systems in the Legumes","type":"project"}]
